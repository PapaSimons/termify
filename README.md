Termify
===
Simple command line tool to search music from spotify and get URIs

## Installing
This tool is ditributed through npm, so:
```npm i -g termify```

## Using
The only parameter termify expects is the `-q` parameter, which should contain the name of the track you're looking for

Example:
```termify -q "Shape of you"```

## Contributing
Termify uses regular NodeJS features. No building processes needed; so just clone the repo, edit and PR me :)
